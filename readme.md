## Goals

1. Implement multiple sorting functions, including sort by name, address, transaction...
    - Should be able to read from some Json and parse the data and sort as needed
    - this requires me to generate some fake json data.
    - handle bad data
2. Write testing code that tests the sorting functions.
3.
